# Microsoft-Excel-Tips-and-Tricks
The quick course is about 100 tips for daily usage of Microsoft Excel. The lectures are the part of Financial Mathematics Course taught at University of Karachi. I have tried my best to gather all the tricks for Finance and Accounting Professionals.

The course would be of great use for the students and professionals working in Audit Firms, Banks and Financial Institutions.

All the lectures are uploaded on YouTube. Also the lecture content and practice files can bo found at my Github Profile.
